A pet project to practice some Data Visualization. Generate some MalikCoin through a faucet and send those to other addresses! You can generate a random hash as an address and 'claim' that account. Then you can use that account to send/receive MalikCoin. There also is a visualization illustrating the cashflows in/out of the accounts you've interacted with.

**Step 1** - Clone down the repository

**Step 2** - Run npm install 

**Step 3** - Run npm start

Please check the following video for a demo of the project!
